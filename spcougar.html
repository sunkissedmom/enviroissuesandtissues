            <h2>Olympic Cougar Project</h2>
            <p>The Olympic Cougar Project in partnership with Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe and non-profit Pathera collars are studies cougars on the peninsula. These studies highlight critical issues concerning the unique cougar population in the
                Olympic Peninsula which is a genetically distinct group. Below is an overview of the causes, impacts, and challenges
                associated with these cougars:</p>
            <h2>Genetic Diversity</h2>
            <p>Low genetic diversity: This cougar population has the lowest genetic diversity of any cougar population
                in PNW. This makes them more vulnerable to diseases, environmental changes, and reduced reproductive success.</p>
            <h2>Causes</h2>
            <p><li><b>I5:</b> Interstate 5 acts as a significant barrier to cougar movement, preventing gene flow between cougar
                    populations in the Olympic Peninsula and other regions.</li></p>
            <p><li><b>Urbanization:</b> Loss of habitat due to deforestation and logging activities disrupts their natural
                    ranges and forces cougars into smaller, fragmented territories.</li></p>
                <li><b>Anthropocentric activities:</b> Land-use changes driven by agriculture, infrastructure development, and
                    recreation further reduce habitat availability.</li></p>
            <p><li><b>Depradation Issues:</b> As cougars are pushed into smaller habitats closer to human areas, they are more likely to prey on
                    livestock and pets. These incidents lead to lethal removal. .</li>
            </p>
            <h2>Conservation Concerns</h2>
            <p>The role of apex predators like cougars in ecosystems is profound, with cascading effects that influence
                nutrient cycling, population dynamics, and habitat structure.</p>
            <p><b>Yellowstone Parallel:</b> Wolves → Elk → Willow Trees<br>
                After wolves were removed from Yellowstone in the 1920s, elk populations exploded, leading to severe
                overgrazing of willow, aspen, and cottonwood trees. This collapse of riparian vegetation caused
                widespread erosion, habitat loss, and reduced biodiversity in aquatic systems.
                The reintroduction of wolves in the 1990s restored balance, as elk behavior and populations shifted.
                Riparian vegetation rebounded, stabilizing streambanks and creating habitats for beavers, fish, and
                birds.</p>
