                    <h2>Hello, I'm Stephanie and this is my sweet pup Fern</h2>
                    <p>
                        Welcome to my page! I am a recently "retired" real estate agent with over a decade of
                        experience. I have a strong interest in environmental issues and justice. Born and raised in
                        Pierce County and a 2005 Kitsap County transplant, I love everything the PNW offers and my
                        primary goal every week is to get to the Olympics. Otherwise I enjoy engaging in activities like
                        telling my dog how cute she is, eating the amazing food my spouse cooks, supporting women in
                        sports, and gardening.</p>

                    <p>I am a proud parent to three daughters and a grandmother to a lively toddler. Currently, I am
                        completing my Environmental Science degree, which I began over 15 years ago.</p>

                    <p>Dedicated to service, I have volunteered with various organizations, including search and rescue
                        and as an Ombudsman during my time as a military spouse. I am currently involved in my community
                        by updating our neighborhood website and putting on events like the <a

                            Manette Edible Garden Tour.</a></p>

                    <p>I created this space to share my passions, have fun, and exchange impactful stories and ideas
                        with you. Feel free to explore and connect!</p>
