                <h2>What Does Service Learning Mean to You?</h2>
                <p>At the start of the quarter, I saw service learning as a way to fulfill an academic requirement by
                    contributing to the community. However, by the end, I came to understand it as a reciprocal
                    processâ€”a chance to apply my knowledge in real-world settings while gaining deeper insights about
                    myself and the needs of our ecological community. It transformed into a bridge between education and
                    meaningful action.</p>
                <h2>What Are Three Things You Learned</h2>
                <p>
                    <li><b>Community Dynamics:</b> This illustrated beautifully how different groups work together to
                        build bridges over barriers and I deepend my awareness of how we are all part of the bigger
                        picture.</li>
                    <li><b>Problem-Solving:</b> Working hands-on encouraged me to look at things more objectively and start thinking about how I can adjust my habits, 
                        be accountable, and take responsibility for things happening in our community.</li>
                    <li><b>Awareness:</b> Engaging directly with my community expanded my perspective on social issues
                        and the importance of active participation.</li></p>
                <h2>What Was the Most Meaningful Experience?</h2>
                <p>The most meaningful experience was volunteering at Salmon Days. Getting to engage with the other
                    class members, volunteers, and the community while providing an enriching experience really filled
                    my heart and deepened my appreciation for everyone who showed up to ralley with the salmon in Chico Creek.
                    Seeing the direct impact of knowlegde I have gained through this class was incredibly profound.</p>
