            <h2>What Does Service Learning Mean to You?</h2>
            <p>At the start of the class, I saw it as a an academic requirement to fulfil by
                contributing to the community - I knew I had to plan out the rest of the term to make sure I was able to
                complete my hours. By the end, I came to understand it as a reciprocal
                processâ€”a chance to apply my knowledge in real-world settings while gaining deeper insights about
                myself and other while meeting some of the demands of our local community. It transformed into a bridge
                between education and
                meaningful action.</p>
            <h2>What Are Three Things You Learned</h2>
            <p>I learned a lot of interesting facts about salmon and their migration, the olympic cougar population, and
                while I already had some knowledge of invasives and
                native plants, i didn't quite understand the signifigance of natural decomposing process and how
                important leaving that material in place (aside from my own garden)
                material... what stood out most was:
                <li><b>Community Dynamics:</b> This project illustrated beautifully how different groups work together
                    to
                    build bridges over barriers and it deepend my appreciation of how we are all part of the bigger
                    picture.</li>
                <li><b>Problem-Solving:</b> Working hands-on encouraged me to look at things more objectively and start
                    thinking about how I can adjust my habits,
                    be accountable, and open my eyes to things happening in our community.</li>
                <li><b>Awareness:</b> Engaging directly with my community expanded my perspective on social issues
                    and the importance of active participation.</li>
            </p>
            <h2>What Was the Most Meaningful Experience?</h2>
            <p>The most meaningful experience was hard to nail down, I enjoyed engaging with the folks at Great
                Peninsula Conservacy and learning about how they came to be part of the organization
                and things they do outside of GPC (lots of things in common!) and I have already seen some of those
                folks out in the community.
                I am really curious in the cougar population on the peninsula and I feel like as we continue to do
                research we will have a
                better understanding of necessary conservation efforts to address their special struggles. Volunteering
                at Salmon Days filled my heart learning from other
                class members, volunteers, and the community in an enriching experience where you get to see real time
                and ralley with the salmon in Chico Creek.
                Also experiencing the direct impact of the knowlegde I have gained through this class was incredibly
                rewarding.</p>
